*Virginia Q. Bloodgood, July 8th, 1946*


This is a very sad time of year for us. Virginia Bloodgood died 21 years ago on this date,
and we are still mourning her loss. She brought so much light and warmth to this world,
more than anyone realized. That is why we are planning to do the same. On April 13th,
2019 we are holding a fundraiser honoring Virginia at The Ballroom At Ellis Preserve (3821 West Chester Pike - Newtown Square, PA 19073). There will be a great deal of heartwarming activities, and a
silent auction to follow suit. We hope you will be able to join us from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM.
